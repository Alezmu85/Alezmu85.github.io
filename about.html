		<p class="title2"><b>Something more about me.</b></h1></p>
		<p id="main2">
			My professional career began with being a teacher. After completing the five-year master's degree in early education, for many years I have had great joy in passing my knowledge to the youngest and developing my artistic skills. In addition to my obvious duties, I also ran creative interest clubs and workshops for children and adults, I created posters and advertising leaflets. In order to improve the services I was providing, I graduated in computer graphics design.<br>
			After some time, I decided to change my path and started working as a website coordinator. I was responsible for the correct assignment of tickets to tasks, and for communication between clients and agents. This occupation - how different from being a teacher, allowed me to observe the correlation between the quality of the delivered product and the level of user satisfaction. <br>
			Moving to California was another career switch opportunity. For three years I worked as a content reviewer checking thousands of applications before publishing them in Play Store. Then I thought again about the importance of consciously planning and designing a product before making it available to the intended user. This made me interested in UX design.<br>
			Who am I? An ambitious and fast learner. Passionate about trying new fields of art. A huge fan of sport, music, traveling, food, and my dog.<br>
			Nice to see you here!
