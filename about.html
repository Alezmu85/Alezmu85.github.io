 <p> My professional career began as a teacher. After completing my master's degree in early childhood education, I had the great joy of passing my knowledge onto the youngest and brightest people while developing my own artistic skills. In addition to my teaching duties, I organized creative interest clubs and workshops for children and adults. In order to improve and promote the services I was providing, I studied computer graphics design and began designing the posters and advertising leaflets for these programs.</p>
<p>After some time, I decided to change my path and started working as a customer support coordinator. In this role, I was responsible for assigning tickets to tasks, and coordinating communications between clients and agents. This occupation, while different from being a teacher, allowed me to observe the correlation between the quality of the delivered product and the level of user satisfaction.</p>
<p>Moving to California was another career-shifting opportunity. For three years I worked as a content reviewer checking thousands of applications before publishing them in the Google Play Store. This experience reinforced the importance of consciously planning and designing a product before making it available to the intended user â€“ ultimately sparking my interest in UX design.</p>
Who am I? An ambitious and fast learner. Passionate about trying new fields of art and expression. A sports, music, travel, food, and dog enthusiast. </p><br>
